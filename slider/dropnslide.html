		<h3><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job description management, as well as other facets of talent management, has been affected by the expansion of information technology. Prior to 2000, there were very few Internet-based human resource solutions available to human resource departments. HR departments often stored their printed job descriptions either in filing cabinets or Word-based job 
		descriptions on computers or company servers. Today there are countless companies offering cloud-based talent management systems to businesses allowing HR to easily store HR information, collaborate with other departments, and access files from any device with Internet access.

Today the job description management industry includes several SaaS (Software as a Service) providers, including those that are incorporated within the recruiting tools of a holistic integrated talent management suite, as well as stand-alone products. Solutions like Halogenâ€™s Job description Builder have enabled integration of recruiting and job description management with broader talent management activities and have empowered HR departments of all sizes to manage and verify the job descriptions for all stake holders, including employees, managers, recruiting, legal, performance management and compensation.

Leading mid-market providers of recruiting solutions that integrate with talent management include SilkRoad and Halogen Software,[2] who in 2011[3] evolved their solution to allow automation of job description building and the incorporation competencies models. While mid-market providers compete by offering their customers additional access to customer service,[4] enterprise solution providers such as SAP or Oracle, offer organizations with over 10,000 employees a solution that integrates more closely with their HRIS. Finally, stand-alone solutions include DBsquared and JDXpert by HRTMS. JDXpert, developed by HRTMS Inc., was the first stand-alone Job Description Management application that allowed organizations to separately manage their job descriptions independently from the other silos of information, while still ensuring that consistent and accurate details could be shared across the enterprise.</p>
